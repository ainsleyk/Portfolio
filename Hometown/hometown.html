<h2>Arizona and New Mexico Mountians</h2>
<h3>Ecoregion 23</h3>
<div id= "led">
<img src='img\ArizonaNewMexicoMountians.PNG' alt="Light Brown">
</div>
<p>The Arizona/New Mexico Mountains are distinguished from neighboring mountainous ecoregions by their lower elevations and an associated vegetation indicative of drier, warmer environments, due in part to the region’s more southerly location. Forests of spruce, fir, and
Douglas-fir, common in the Southern Rockies (21) and the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains (19), are only found in limited areas at the highest elevations in this region. Chaparral is common at lower elevations in some areas, pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands occur at lower and
middle elevations, and the higher elevations are mostly covered with open to dense ponderosa pine forests. These mountains are the northern extent of some Mexican plant and animal species. Surrounded by deserts or grasslands, these mountains in Arizona and New Mexico can
be considered biogeographical islands.</p>

<h2>Arizona and New Mexico Plateau</h2>
<h3>Ecoregion 22</h3>
<div id= "led">
<img src='img\ArizonaNewMexicoPlateau.PNG' alt="Light Orange">
</div>
<p>The Arizona/New Mexico Plateau represents a large transitional region between the drier shrublands and wooded higher relief tablelands of the Colorado Plateaus (20) in the north, the lower, hotter, less vegetated Mojave Basin and Range (14) in the west, the semiarid grasslands
of the Southwestern Tablelands (26) to the east, and the forested mountain ecoregions that border the region on the northeast (21) and south (23). Local relief in the region varies from a few feet on plains and mesa tops, to well over 1000 feet along tableland side slopes. The
region extends across northern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and into the San Luis Valley of Colorado. Gunnison prairie dogs are a keystone species in many of the sagebrush ecosystems and their burrows provide habitat for other wildlife including burrowing owls,
weasels, badgers, and a variety of snakes.</p>

<h2>Chihuahuan Deserts</h2>

<h2>Colorado Plateau</h2>
<h3>Ecoregion 20</h3>
<div id= "led">
<img src='img\ColoradoPlateau.PNG' alt="Light Brown">
</div>
<p>A long geologic history is exposed in the rock formations of the canyons, mesas, plateaus, and mountains of Ecoregion 20. Rugged tableland topography is typical of the Colorado Plateaus. Precipitous side-walls mark abrupt changes in local relief, often of 1000 to 2000 feet or
more. The region is more elevated than the Wyoming Basin (18) to the north and therefore contains a far greater extent of pinyon-juniper and Gambel oak woodlands. However, the region also has large low-lying areas containing saltbush-greasewood and blackbrush communities
(typical of hotter, drier areas), which are generally not found in the higher Arizona/New Mexico Plateau (22) to the south where grasslands are typically more common.</p>

<h2>Madrean Archipelago</h2>
<h3>Ecoregion 24</h3>
<div id= "led">
<img src='img\MadreanArchipelago.PNG' alt="Light Brown">
</div>
<p>Also known as the Sky Islands in the United States, this is a region of basins and ranges with medium to high local relief, typically 3000 to 5000 feet. Native vegetation in the region is mostly grama-tobosa shrub-steppe in the basins and oak-juniper woodlands on the ranges,
except at higher elevations where ponderosa pine is predominant. The region has ecological significance as both a barrier and bridge between two major cordilleras of North America, the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Madre Occidental. Its exceptional species richness and
endemism are also influenced by both western desert and mid-continent prairie biogeography.</p>

<h2>Mojave Basin and Range</h2>
<h3>Ecoregion 79</h3>
<div id= "led">
<img src='img\MojaveBasinandRange.PNG' alt="Light Orange">
</div>
<p>Stretching across southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and northwestern Arizona, Ecoregion 14 is composed of broad basins and scattered mountains that are generally lower, warmer, and drier than those of the Central Basin and Range (13). Its
creosotebush-dominated shrub community is distinct from the saltbush–greasewood and sagebrush–grass communities that occur to the north in the Central Basin and Range (13) and Northern Basin and Range (80); it also differs from the paloverde–cactus shrub and saguaro
cactus that occur in the Sonoran Basin and Range (81) to the south. In the Mojave, creosotebush, white bursage, Joshua tree and other yuccas, and blackbrush are typical. On alkali flats, saltbush, saltgrass, alkali sacaton, and iodinebush are found. On mountains, sagebrush,
juniper, and singleleaf pinyon occur. At high elevations, some ponderosa pine, white fir, limber pine, and bristlecone pine can be found. The basin soils are mostly Entisols and Aridisols that typically have a thermic temperature regime; they are warmer than those of Ecoregion 13
to the north. Heavy use of off-road vehicles and motorcycles in some areas has made the soils susceptible to wind- and water-erosion. Most of Ecoregion 14 is federally owned and grazing is constrained by the lack of water and forage for livestock.</p>

<h2>Sonoran Basin and Range</h2>
<h3>Ecoregion 81</h3>
<div id= "led">
<img src='img\SonoraBasinandRange.PNG' alt="Light Brown">
</div>
<p>Similar in topography to the Mojave Basin and Range to the north, this ecoregion contains scattered low mountains and has large tracts of federally owned lands, a large portion of which are used for military training. However, the Sonoran Basin and Range is slightly hotter than
the Mojave and contains large areas of paloverde-cactus shrub and giant saguaro cactus, whereas the potential natural vegetation in the Mojave is largely creosotebush. Other typical Sonoran plants include white bursage, ocotillo, brittlebush, creosotebush, catclaw acacia, cholla,
desert saltbush, pricklypear, ironwood, and mesquite. In the region, winter rainfall decreases from west to east, while summer rainfall decreases from east to west. Aridisols and Entisols are dominant with hyperthermic soil temperatures and extremely aridic soil moisture regimes.</p>
